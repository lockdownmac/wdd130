            <p>Hello Everyone! My name is Joshua McEwen and I am originally from Las Vegas, NV, US. I am a retired Police Officer of 20 years in Las Vegas. My wife and I have 4 children, two of which are still at home, so we wanted to raise them in a better environment than that of Las Vegas, so we moved to my wife's hometown of Spanish Fork, UT. I enjoy playing ice hockey, and all of the outdoor eactivites of hunting, fishing, hiking, camping, etc. I'm back in school trying to finish my degree so I can become a fulltime highschool teacher. I'm looking forward to this class and am excited to meet all of you!</p>
